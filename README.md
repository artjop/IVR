Abstract:

Our research aims to uncover the factors driving the evolution of Kitay-town into a subcultural hotspot in Moscow. By analyzing urban cultural patterns, we seek to understand the diversity of cultural and social life in the city.

Our study employs spatial analysis methods and surveys to investigate this transformation. Although limited by age criteria of respondents, the findings could benefit urban governance in addressing unlawful activities and guide entrepreneurs on successful operations in this area.

Focusing on Kitay-town's vernacular area, we explore the influences on its functional evolution. Tasks include analyzing historical functions, assessing current attractions, conducting spatial analysis, and surveying subculture representatives.

Hypotheses propose Kitay-town's centrality due to its strategic location, socio-economic changes driving new attractions, and unique features making it a youth subculture hub rooted in historical heritage.
